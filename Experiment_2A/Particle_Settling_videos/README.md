These are all the sequenctial videos taken during the experiment which was to record the particles' moverments from one specific 
part of the liquid columns to another specific end points and to get the time of traversal. Original videos were taken in 
slowmo version which are further trimmed to show the actual parts of concern and are also adjusted with the specific FPS of the
camera used to scale the time to actual time-flow.
